tips:

- we need to find many vectors and matrices (H, P, ...)
- maximise margin. computation: cvxopt. lamda is distance
- soft margin: slack variables (C)

K = xi * xj.T * yi * yj
K: matrix (NxN)

- non-linear svm:
- phi function has to be guessed (?)
- kernel trick: first calculate kernel, then projection into more dimensions
