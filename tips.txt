SVM:
    To calculate bias: only use support vectors that are exactly on the margin
Naive Bayes:
    loop over each word in the message + prior
    but: counting how many times "university/money" occurs in the email
    compute log likelihood of mails
    p is division p(w|s)/p(w|h)
Logistic Regression:
    run Mnist file for classification results
    cost function: not really neccessary to get the code running
        abort when this function gets close to 0
    first derivative:
        slide 27: weight parameters
        Hessian matrix: slide 30 = 3x3 in toy example
        we do not need to use the minus
    + iterative algorithm
    regularization:
        prevents overfitting: choose the simplest function
        cost function: 35: norm of w
        second derivative: derive the first derivation: only entrices on the diagonal (still 3x3 with 0,0 to 0)
        don't regularize the bias
